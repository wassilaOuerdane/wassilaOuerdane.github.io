Session 2. 
--------------------------------


The second session aims at presenting Multi-Agent Based Simulation. We will first introduce what a simulation is, the different stages that compose it and the time's representation used in simulation. Then, we will present more precisely Multi-Agent Based Simulation and its context of use. To finish, we will talk about how to implement and manage the problems of time and concurrency.

As for the previous session, all implementation is done using the Python programming language and the Mesa library.
