Session 3. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Multiagent systems is not just about having different processes (or piece of code) that run in parallel, as we did in the previous sessions. Indeed, agents need to share some information to work together.

In the Alice and Bob examples (session 1, section 2) as well as in the Multi-Agent Based Simulation you implemented in the second session, agents worked separately and acted, in a concurrent manner, on a shared variable in the environment. This very primitive type of interactions is called *indirect interactions*. We will give a brief presentation of indirect interaction mechanisms in the first section of today's course session.

In the Money example (session 1, section 4), agents act directly on their peers variables. This is not supposed to happen in a MAS: agents can only interact with their environment. However, it is often required that agents request modifications to other agents. Such mechanisms are called *direct interactions* and will be presented in the second section of this course session.

The third section will give you an overview of software engineering practices and tools that you should adopt as MAS designers.

The fourth section will present a Mesa-based library for direct interactions that we shall use in the remaining of this course.

As for the previous sessions, all implementation is done using the Python programming language and the Mesa library.
