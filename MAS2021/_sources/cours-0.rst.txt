Multiagent Systems: architercture and reasoning
================================================================

General presentation of the course (Agenda)
-------------------------------------------

This course aims at presenting basic notions and concepts of multi-agent systems. It is organised as follows:

1. Friday, March the 5th, 2021 : Introduction to MAS : definitions and implementation of a platform
2. Friday, March the 12th, 2021 : Multiagent simulation : preys and predators
3. Friday, March the 19th, 2021 : Interaction mechanisms : models and implementation
4. Friday, March the 26th, 2021 : Practical session
5. Friday, April the 2nd, 2021 : Argumentation-based negotiation I: what is argumentation?
6. Friday, April the 9th, 2021 : Argumentation-based negotiation II: what is a negotiation protocol?
7. Friday, April the 16th, 2021 : Practical session


Contents
-------------

The first three sessions will give you the basics of MAS architectures and platforms. Based on this knowledge, you will implement a simple multi-agent based simulation (session 2) that will be evaluated by the teachers. This evaluation will be based on your source code and a very short report of your work. Its aim is to assess that you have acquired the basics of MAS.

Sessions 3 to 7 will be dedicated to a more complex project that combines argumentation and negotiation models with the MAS architecture. This will give rise to a second multi-agent based model.
